# casual.py
- Automated reddit manager that sends offline content and media to people or groups.
- A reddit account is a must. Bot iterates the posts from the followed subreddits.
- This is an automated casual bot extension, for me, it sends new reddit posts and media contents in every 20 minutes. I don't need to click on a link or anything. They are in the messages.
